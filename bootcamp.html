    <h1>Cyber Boot Camp</h1>
    <p>This winter break, from 1/02/17 to 1/12/17, is the third annual CBC, a 
        week long hands-on cybersecurity trip in beautiful Los Alamos and Albuquerque 
        New Mexico at Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories. Be sure to take part 
        in this awesome experience!<br /><br />

        <b>The event requires an application deposit of $250.</b> This deposit confirms you are 
        committed to attending the trip as well as covers all of your transportation and housing 
        should you be accepted. Your only expense during the trip will be your own food. <br /><br />

        Each applicant is reviewed by a student/faculty committee and sorted by their involvement 
        in SIG-Security and their CS Research needs. <br /><br />

        The event requires no prior experience, however, the more advanced the topics the more attendees 
        will gain from the trip; therefore we will be selecting intermediate topics and intentionally 
        cover material that is not available within our CS curriculum.<br /><br />

        In order to attend you need to both (1) be a US Citizen as well as (2) have a federally approved ID. 
        These include a passport OR [a driver license AND (a Social Security card OR birth certificate)].<br /><br />

        We will be accepting up to 20 applicants. If you are not accepted then you will <b>immediately receive a 
        refund for your full deposit.</b> If you are accepted but choose not to attend, then you will <b>forfeit your 
        deposit.</b> <br /><br />

        We are anticipating $250 as the upper bound of the trip's cost. However, due to the complex logistics of this 
        trip and in order to not fall behind schedule we must open registration before we know the ultimate cost. 
        This is unavoidable. In the worst case scenario that the trip becomes logistically infeasible with one 
        of the laboratories then everyone who was accepted will be in communication to adjust appropriately. 
        If the trip does not continue in any form then everyone will be fully refunded. <br /><br />

        We will be driving to and from New Mexico which means we will need attendees to volunteer their vehicles 
        for the trip. We are expecting to take <b>four vehicles. Gas and some wear and tear will be provided</b> to 
        those who volunteer their vehicles.  <br /><br />

        We are looking forward to an another amazing iteration of this event. After the 20 attendees are selected, 
        those who are accepted will receive more information on the event (the training offered, etc).  <br /><br />

        All questions about the trip should be directed to esmxv3@mst.edu.

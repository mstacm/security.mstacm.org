			<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Advanced technologies in various fields bring us benefits and enhance our lives. However, magnified power and capability have been given to the attackers by technology as well. In security protocol proposed to resolve authentication and identify problems. ZKPs are interactive, so one party can convince the other party the some assertion is true without revealing anything else. The semly contradictory definition makes the ZKPs very powerful tools for the design of secure cryptographic protocols. Donâ€™t miss this basic tutorial that will cover its background, important concepts, examples, applications, and future direction.</p>
			<p><strong>Biography: </strong>Li Feng received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T) in 2015. Her research interest is in the area of Computer Security in distributed embedded system that involves security protocol analysis and information flow quantification in cross-disciplinary architectures. She now works as Post Doctoral Fellow at Missouri S&T and will be an Assistant Professor of Math, Computer Science and Physics at Capital University, Columbus, OH in fall 2016.</p>

			<p><strong>Place: </strong>CS207</p>
			
			<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Red Teaming is a methodology used to analyze and assess seucrity vulnerabilities that exist in an organization's computer infrastructure. In today's security conscious society, it is a vitally important tool that can help reduce the risk associated with maintaining the complex networks that store our sensitive information. This talk discusses the role of Red Teaming in securing computer networks and will include a live Red Teaming demonstration (against ACM SIG-Sec's mockup network test-bed). Also, prizes will be awarded to the winning team in the 10th annual wireless security audit of Rolla. </p>
			<p><strong>Biography: </strong>William D. Atkins is a Senior Member of Technical Staff in the Assurance Technologies and Assessments Department at Sandia National Laboratories, where he conducts information assurance research and engages in red teaming exercises to secure critical information and control system infrastructures against attack from a variety of adversaries. He is the Co-Program Lead of Sandia's Information Design Assurance Red Team. Atkins received both Masters and Bachelors of Science degrees in Computer Engineering from the University of Missouri-Rolla, now the Missouri University of Science and Technology, in 2007 and 2005, respectively. His research interests include wireless communications systems, communications protocol analysis, embedded systems design, and reverse engineering. </p>

			<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Advanced Research in Cyber Systems office (ARCS) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) leads research and development for technical solutions to national security challenges in the cyberspace domain. Our mission includes developing next-generation cyber systems to counter contemporary adversaries in cyberspace, performing data and computatonally intensive cyber analytics, and evalutating and advancing new game-changing technologies. Aaron Pope and Chris Rawlings will present current and future projects as well as a general overview of cyber security research at LANL.</p>
			<p><strong>Biography: </strong>Chris Rawlings is a scientist at LANL in the Advanced Research in Cyber Systems office of the Analytics, Intelligence, and Technology Division. He is also a recent Missouri S&amp;T alumnus, having graduated with degrees in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.</p>	
			<p>Aaron Pope received his Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2013 from Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&amp;T). He is current;y pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at S&amp;T with a focus on applying genetic programming techniques to problems in computer network security. He has spent the last two summers interning in the Advanced Research in Cyber Systems office (ARCS, formerly Advanced Computing Solutions) at LANL. He lives in Rolla with his fiance and daughter.</p>

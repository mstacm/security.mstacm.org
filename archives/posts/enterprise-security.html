			<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Internet of Things (IoT) is being used by adversaries to develop botnets for Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Industrial control systems, critical infrastructure, and even cars are becoming targets of attacks. The average time to detect and respond to security incidents is increasing. This talk will address the challenges of defending a modern enterprise: tools, risk management and resource allocation, threat modeling and risk analysis, Lockheed Martin’s Cyber Kill Chain, human factors of information security, topics in security architecture, and motivations and behaviors of adversaries. We will also look at why current and historic defense mechanisms have failed.</p>

			<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Wireless communications systems and networks have become an accepted means of connecting information and control system assets. Because many critical assets are now connected to networks wirelessly, testing the security of such systems has become a fundamental step in audits, assessments, and red teaming exercises. This talk discusses the role of challenges faces in assessing the security of wireless systems and networks, and provides insight into the basic gear and tools required in assessing 802.11a/b/g/n wireless networks.</p>
			<p><strong>Biography: </strong>William D. Atkins is a Principal Member of Technical Staff in the Cyber Physical Security Department at Sandia National Laboratories, where he conducts information assurance research and engages in red teaming exercises to secure critical information and control system infrastructures against attack from a variety of adversaries. He is the Program Lead of Sandia's Information Design Assurance Red Team (IDART). Atkins received both Masters and Bachelors of Science degrees in Computer Engineering from the University of Missouri-Rolla, now the Missouri University of Science and Technology, in 2007 and 2005, respectively. His research interests include wireless communication systems, communications protocol analysis, embedded systems design, and reverse engineering.</p>

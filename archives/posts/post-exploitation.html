			<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>You, as the attacker, popped a shell on your target host. Now what? Escalating privileges, rifling for treasure, gleaming what you can, pivoting deeper into your target environment, and maintaining a persistent connection should be your next objectives. This is “post-exploitation,” the important but often forgotten or poorly executed phase of offensive security testing.</p>
